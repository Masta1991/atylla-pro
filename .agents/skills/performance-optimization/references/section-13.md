## Red Flags

- Optimization without profiling data to justify it
- N+1 query patterns in data fetching
- An index added without a query plan before and after to justify it
- A cache key that omits an input the response depends on (tenant, locale, viewer)
- A cache with no stated staleness window and no invalidation strategy
- Connection pool size raised in response to exhaustion, without finding what holds connections
- List endpoints without pagination
- Images without dimensions, lazy loading, or responsive sizes
- Bundle size growing without review
- No performance monitoring in production
- `React.memo` and `useMemo` everywhere (overusing is as bad as underusing)
- Optimizations kept without a re-measurement that justifies them
- Several optimizations bundled into one measurement, so no single change can be attributed
- A "win" that required a test to be changed, skipped, or deleted
- The same failed optimization attempted more than once because nobody recorded the first attempt
