### Secrets

Secrets come from the environment. `.env.example` is committed with placeholders; real `.env*` files and key material are gitignored; grep the staged diff before committing. **A secret that reaches a remote is compromised the moment it lands: rotate it first, then purge history.**

Pattern: [Secrets management](hardening-patterns.md#secrets-management).
