## Verification

After designing an API:

- [ ] Every endpoint has typed input and output schemas
- [ ] Error responses follow a single consistent format
- [ ] Validation happens at system boundaries only
- [ ] List endpoints support pagination
- [ ] New fields are additive and optional (backward compatible)
- [ ] Naming follows consistent conventions across all endpoints
- [ ] API documentation or types are committed alongside the implementation
- [ ] State-changing endpoints either honour an idempotency key or are documented as unsafe to retry
- [ ] The key is claimed in one atomic operation, guarded by a unique constraint
- [ ] A reused key with a different payload fails loudly rather than replaying the wrong response
- [ ] The in-flight-duplicate response is a deliberate choice (409, wait, or 202) rather than whatever falls out
- [ ] Key retention outlives the longest retry path, including dead-letter replay
